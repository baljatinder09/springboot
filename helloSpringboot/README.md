# Spring boot hello Project
Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service. It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications
## Requirements
For building and running the application you need.

 - Spring boot version 2.2.2
 - Java 8
 - Apache Maven 3.3.9
 - Eclipse Id

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the  `main`  method in the  `com.singh.HelloSpringbootApplication`  class from your IDE. We have created a simple spring boot project to call the REST service and get simple message on UI screen.

Alternatively you can use the  [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html)  like so:
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
